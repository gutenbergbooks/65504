</div>
<p>It is difficult now to realize that Wisconsin, famed as a dairy
state and rich in farm land and thriving communities, was once a
great wilderness. Before the land was cleared for the farmer&rsquo;s plow
and with its dense forests yet to hear the lumberjack&rsquo;s axe, the thick
timberland of the north and even the rolling prairies of the central and
southern portions of our state teemed with a great variety of wild life,
including animals no longer occurring in Wisconsin, such as the woodland
caribou, moose, elk, and buffalo or bison, as well as the more familiar
deer, bear, and many smaller varieties.</p>
<p>Before the arrival of the Europeans, this Wisconsin wilderness was the
home of Indians who were wonderfully adapted to a life in the forests.
They depended almost entirely on hunting and the gathering of natural
products for their food, shelter, clothing, tools, and weapons, although
most of them raised some garden crops such as corn, squash, beans, and
possibly tobacco.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend that we can travel backwards in time about 350 years
and visit a typical Indian family of that period. As we arrive on the
scene the tribe is preparing to set up a new camp. The women are busy
unpacking their household gear, including reed mats used to cover the
outer sides of the wigwam. The women themselves have carried the loads
during the journey. This is not done because of any laziness on the part
of the men, a common error of white observers, but simply because the
men need their hands free to ward off a sudden enemy attack, or to kill
any game they might chance upon during the journey.</p>
<p>While the women unpack, the men enter the woods to cut poles for
the framework of the wigwams, and collect birch bark for the roofs. After
the poles are set into the ground to make an oval enclosure, they are bent
and tied together at the top to form a rounded roof. The women then tie
on the reed mats, and roof the hut with the rolls of bark. This is the
typical Wisconsin Indian winter lodge. Although it is the latter part of
March, the weather is still too cold to live comfortably in a summer lodge.</p>
<p>If we lift the bearskin covering the entrance and step into the lodge,
we may see the simple furnishings and personal possessions of the family
we are going to visit. A hole in the middle of the roof serves to carry off
the smoke from the fire burning in the center of the floor. This fire serves
the double purpose of heating the lodge and cooking the family meals.
We find the hut almost too smoky to endure, accustomed as we are to our
modern homes, but our Indian friends seem quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Since our Indian family is fairly large, including the father&rsquo;s parents
as well as the mother, father, two boys, and two girls, the wigwam is proportionately
large in order to accommodate all of them.</p>
<p>We look about the inside of the lodge and see the sleeping mats and
furs. The family&rsquo;s spare clothing, breechclouts, shirts, leggings, and moccasins
of tanned deerskin for the men, and skirts, blouses, and moccasins
for the women, are in one corner. The garments are beautifully decorated
with designs grandma embroidered on them with dyed porcupine quills.
The work is quite fine and it takes many hours to do a small portion of the
embroidery. Father is especially fond of his headdress, a roach made of
deer and porcupine hair, and an eagle feather which indicates that he
has killed an enemy in battle.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>As we step outside again and look about, we can see why this particular
spot has been chosen as the campsite. A small lake and several springs
are only a short distance away, but the most important reason for camping
here at this season is a large grove of sugar maple trees immediately
to one side of the camp. March is the proper time to tap the trees for
their sap.</p>
<p>The next two or three weeks are spent tapping the trees, and boiling
the sap down until maple syrup, and finally only maple sugar is left.
This sugar keeps indefinitely and provides a very nourishing as well as a
delicious source of food for the entire family. The children are especially
fond of it.</p>
<p>It is not a case of all work and no play during this period, for the
children, Morning Star, White Fawn, Blackbird, and Little Otter, play
games when their tasks are finished, and gambling games are popular with
the men and women. Here we see mother and some neighbor women
playing the cup and pin game. Each player in turn tosses into the air
small cone-shaped cups made of antler tips or bear-toe bones, and tries
to catch one or more on a bone pin. The men are enthusiastic gamblers,
too, using marked sticks which are thrown and scored somewhat like our
own familiar dice games.</p>
<p>When the sugar making is finished, the tribe breaks camp and travels
by birch-bark canoe to a new location. The canoes are wonderfully light
boats and can be paddled very swiftly. Their light weight makes them
relatively easy to carry or portage from one stream to another. Our canoe
has eyes painted on the bow and stern. The father explains that these eyes
enable the canoe to &ldquo;see where to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the new summer camp we watch our friends build summer lodges.
These are rectangular in shape with inverted-V-shaped roofs much like
our own houses. The entire lodge is covered with strips of elm or
other bark.</p>
<p>As is often the case, the new campsite is near a river, and springs nearby
furnish cool, pure drinking water. There are also open clearings closeby
which will be utilized for gardening. The next few weeks, however, will
be used for making necessary utensils and equipment needed by the tribe.</p>

<p class="pcap">ANCIENT WOODLAND POTTERY VESSEL.</p>
</div>
<p>One day we are interested observers of pottery making. Grandma goes
to a clay bed near the river and selects suitable materials including some
coarse sand for tempering the pottery paste, which is made of both clay
and sand. The paste is worked into long cylinders which are finally coiled
about into the desired shape. After the vessel has assumed final shape
it is paddled with a cord-wrapped tool and allowed to air-dry for several
days, and finally baked in a large outdoor fire. The finished pot can be
used to boil water or cook food, and has the advantage of being easily
replaced in case of breakage.</p>
<p>May soon arrives, and as this is the time to plant corn, our Indian
family selects a suitable clearing for their garden. The men burn out
the underbrush and the women and girls prepare for the planting itself.
Grandma informs us that it is always best to soak the grains in water
several days before seeding. After the seeds have been properly softened,
the women and girls dig holes in the ground, place six or seven grains
of corn in each hole, and then heap up the dirt over the seeds in a little
hillock. Squash and beans are planted in the clearing, too.</p>
<p>One day we are told that the tribe is going to have a game drive,
since considerable meat is needed by the village. We go along into the
forest and watch the men chop down trees with their stone axes. These
are all felled in one direction, the cut incomplete so that the tree is still
attached to the stump, and in two rows so as to leave a gradually narrowing
corridor more than a mile long. The deer are then driven towards the
corridor where men stationed with bows are able to shoot them easily as
they approach the narrow opening between the barriers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>A number of the animals are killed in this way and taken back to the
village where their flesh can be preserved by being cut into strips and
smoke-dried. We are all too hungry, however, to wait until we return
to the village before eating. The chief says we can have some boiled
venison stew. We are puzzled at this, for no utensils have been brought
along, but we soon learn how resourceful our Indian friends are.</p>
<p>One of the men obtains some edible roots; another cuts the stomachs
from several of the deer. Each one of the stomachs is cleaned and tied
to form a pouch. The venison, roots, and some wild rice which some
of the men brought along, are placed in the prepared deer stomachs, water
added, and the ingenious &ldquo;kettles&rdquo; suspended over a slow fire. In a
relatively short time a delicious stew is set before each of us, served in
birch-bark dishes prepared in a few minutes by another of the hunters.</p>
<p>While we are eating we ask the father of the Indian family we are
visiting how the chief of his tribe obtained his position. We are told
that his ability as a warrior and leader has led to his being chosen war
chief, and his ability as an orator and his power to make people like him
has kept him in authority. He says that in a nearby village the chief is
also a great war leader, but he is not well liked otherwise. For that
reason he sometimes finds it difficult to make his warriors obey him and
he is therefore not nearly as powerful as our leader. We soon realize that
the Indian chiefs depend primarily upon personal prestige and influence
to keep them in power. We are informed, however, that in some other
tribes the chief is always selected from a certain clan.</p>

<p class="pcap">YOUTH FASTING FOR A VISION (PAINTING BY A. O. TIEMANN).</p>
</div>
<p>One morning we witness a curious ceremony. Grandfather offers
Blackbird, the older boy, some charcoal as well as his food. The father
seems very proud when his son rejects the food, applies the charcoal to
his face, and leaves the village to enter the forest alone. Grandfather
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
explains that Blackbird, by accepting the charcoal, automatically agreed
to fast alone in the forest for one day. This one-day fast will be good
training for the day when he will feel ready to go on the long fast of four
or five days. Every man has taken this long fast in the hope of seeing a
vision of a guardian spirit who would then be his lifetime protector.</p>
<p>The girls, too, must fast, but in a somewhat different fashion. Soon
Morning Star, the older girl in our friend&rsquo;s family, will reach womanhood
and be segregated for a number of days in a secluded lodge, and during
this period no men may approach her.</p>
<p>The summer season rapidly nears an end. We have enjoyed ourselves
watching the activities of our friends at work and at play. We have
learned, too, some of the beliefs of our friends. Grandfather has told us
stories about the great white bear with the copper tail who dwells underground
and is the greatest power for evil. He has told the children how
the &ldquo;Indian Sandman,&rdquo; a good-natured elf, would put people to sleep at
night by hitting them on the head with a soft war club. We have learned,
too, of the many spirits for good and evil who control the sun, moon, stars,
winds, rain, thunder, and all the other phenomena of nature. One evening
he pointed out the Milky Way and told us that this was the road over
which the dead travelled to the land of the spirits. He also warned us
about entering the woods alone at night because of the evil, living skeleton
which haunts the forest paths seeking unwary men.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE RICE GATHERER.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Autumn, the time for harvesting garden crops as well as various wild
vegetable foods, is a season of hard work for all. Corn is the most important
garden crop, and from time to time we have sampled the ripe
grain. The women have served us some roasted on the cob, or the fresh
kernels ground with a wooden mortar and pestle and served as a sort of
porridge. The ripe corn is now gathered and the ears will be allowed to
dry. The dried kernels can then be ground into a meal, as needed, since
the dry corn will remain edible for a long time.</p>
<p>Wild rice is the most important vegetable food provided for the Indians
by nature. One day, in the middle of September, we all go a short
distance up the river in our canoes and enter a small lake. Here the
wild grain grows in great quantities. The men selected by the chief to
determine when the rice is ready to be gathered have already given us
the signal that the grain is ripe. We learn, however, that one more function
is required before we can proceed with the harvesting of the rice.</p>
<p>The chief medicine man of our village approaches the edge of the
water and blows tobacco smoke towards the heavens as an offering to
his &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Master of the Rice.&rdquo; He then buries a small
portion of tobacco in the ground, and we are ready to proceed.</p>
<p>In each canoe, as the man poles the boat slowly through the rice, the
woman, who sits facing the man, pulls the stalks over the canoe with one
cedar stick, while with another stick she beats the ripe grain into the boat.
When the canoes are full, we head back for camp where the rice is spread
out to dry.</p>
<p>Then the women heat the unhusked kernels in a pot over a slow fire until
all have partially popped open. Next a small pit is dug and a stake set
into the ground beside it. The depression is lined with buckskin and
filled with the parched grain. The father then takes hold of the stake,
steps into the grain-filled pit, and begins treading the grain with his
feet to loosen the husks from the kernels.</p>
<p>The women take the grain from the pit and toss it up and down in
bark winnowing trays. The wind blows away the light chaff as the grain
is tossed into the air, and allows only the kernels to fall back into the tray.</p>
<p>The time soon arrives for our friends to break camp and seek a winter
campsite where the hunting is known to be good. Hunting and fishing
will be the main source of food during the winter season.</p>
<p>At the new campsite, storage pits lined with birch bark are dug in
the ground to be used for storing the nuts, dried berries, dried corn,
and rice that have been gathered and prepared during the Autumn. If
hunting is poor, or if a severe winter threatens famine to the village,
this stored food may be the sole means of preventing starvation.</p>
<p>It is now time for us to leave our Indian friends, but before we go we
learn that the winter season will be spent not only in the pursuits of
fishing through the ice and hunting, but also, in the telling of stories,
singing, and playing many different games. When the snows are deep, the
tribe will don snowshoes for their hunting trips. We will miss seeing
them play snowsnake. In this game the Indians compete with each other
to see who can hurl the wooden &ldquo;snake&rdquo; the greatest distance across the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
snow or ice. We are sorry to miss all these things, but the time has come
for us to end our visit.</p>
<p>As we say farewell to our friends from the distant past, we reflect regretfully
that the coming of the white man will change the old ways of
life for these people of the forests, and soon their independence and
freedom will vanish forever. The Indians seem destined to become largely
dependent upon the whites for their livelihood, and even for the few
remnants of land to be left them for their homes.</p>

<br />WISCONSIN&rsquo;S INDIANS UNDER FRENCH RULE</h2>

<p class="pcap">THE FUR TRADERS (MUSEUM MURAL BY A. O. TIEMANN).</p>
</div>
<p>Few of us realize that the early history of Wisconsin is as romantic
as any our eastern seaboard states can boast. The area that is
now the State of Wisconsin became the gateway into the Middlewest
and the meeting place for the French and the Indian tribes of what
was then regarded as the West. This early period of French control was
an era in which Jesuit missionaries carried the doctrine of Christianity
from village to village, often visiting tribes that had never before seen
white men. It was a time when the French traders, lured by the love
of adventure and romance as well as the wealth to be obtained in the
fur trade, pushed through the forests and followed strange rivers until
they reached the villages of unknown Wisconsin Indians. It was in these
villages that such traders, including the &ldquo;noblest&rdquo; youth of New France,
lived with the Indians, sat in their councils, took part in their war dances,
accompanied their war parties to battle, and often married their women.</p>
<p>It was in this early French Regime that Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indian tribes
underwent great changes in their manner of life due to contacts with the
white man&rsquo;s civilization, It was a time of warfare and a struggle for
supremacy in North America between the British and the French, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
their Indian allies, with Wisconsin&rsquo;s tribes espoused to the cause of the
French. It was the heyday of the fur trade with literally millions of
beaver and other skins being taken from Wisconsin to enrich the trader
and obtain white man&rsquo;s goods for the Indians.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians all lived in pretty much the
same manner, most of us are aware that there were different tribes in our
state at various times, and that they spoke different languages in some
instances. If we use a comparison from European languages, we might
better understand the character of these Indian languages. German,
English, and Swedish all originated from the same parent tongue and
belong to the same basic language division. English and Chinese are unrelated
tongues belonging to different basic language stocks. Thus, while
many words are very similar in English and German, in English and
Chinese no apparent similarity exists.</p>
<p>Three basic language divisions, Algonkian, Siouan, and Iroquoian,
were represented by Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians. Algonkian was represented by
such tribes as the Menomini, Potawatomi, Chippewa, Mascouten, Sauk,
Fox, Ottawa, and Kickapoo. Relatively late arrivals to Wisconsin (in
the 1800&rsquo;s), also speaking Algonkian tongues, were the Munsee, Brotherton,
and Stockbridge tribes. The Siouan group included the Winnebago,
and the Santee division of the Dakota Sioux. The Huron and the Oneida
(the latter also arriving in the 1800&rsquo;s) were Wisconsin representatives of
the Iroquoian language stock. The differences become more apparent
when we realize that languages in the Iroquoian division would be as
different from those in the Algonkian stock as English is from Chinese.</p>
<p>The historic period in Wisconsin began when Jean Nicolet, the first
known white man to visit Wisconsin, landed near what is now Green
Bay, in 1634. Nicolet&rsquo;s mission was to arrange a peace between the powerful
Winnebago tribe, or Puans, as they were known to the French, and
the Ottawa who were then acting as middlemen between the French
and the Indians of the unknown Middlewest.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="548" />
<p class="pcap">THE LANDING OF NICOLET (MUSEUM MURAL BY GEORGE PETER).</p>
</div>
<p>Nicolet&rsquo;s journey into the Wisconsin wilderness, a mere fourteen years
after the landing of our pilgrim forefathers at Plymouth Rock, was the
beginning of the period of French exploration and rule in Wisconsin
which is as romantic and fascinating a story as any in our country&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
history. Imagine Nicolet&rsquo;s emotion as he approached his destination,
a lone white man with seven Indians for companions, in a country
which, as far as was known, had never before been visited by a white
man. He had no idea as to what sort of reception he would receive from
these strange people he was to visit. Their friendliness or enmity would
be determined upon arrival. Fortunately he was hailed as a great visitor,
and feasted and entertained accordingly.</p>
<p>Only three Indian tribes are definitely known to have been residents
of Wisconsin when Nicolet visited here in 1634. These were the Winnebago;
the Menomini, who resided along the shores of the Menominee
River above Green Bay; and the Santee Sioux, whose villages were
scattered along the upper reaches of the Mississippi River in northwestern
Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota.</p>
<p>Documentary evidence strongly suggests that some other tribes, often
mentioned as early residents, as, for example, the Mascouten, did not
arrive until a generation later. Archaeological findings conclusively show
the prehistoric occupation of Wisconsin by the Santee Sioux and the
Winnebago, and support the probability of prehistoric occupation by the
Menomini. Thus Wisconsin was controlled primarily by Siouan speaking
peoples in 1634. The peaceful Menomini were far outnumbered by
their powerful neighbors, the Winnebago, but this situation was soon
to change radically.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="1017" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">WINNEBAGO VILLAGE (PAINTING BY A. O. TIEMANN).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Events occurring far to the East, in what is now New York State and
eastern Canada, were to profoundly affect and change the Indian population
of Wisconsin. When the French began permanent settlement
along the St. Lawrence they found the Huron and the Iroquois Confederacy
engaged in a death struggle for supremacy in the area. The
French espoused the cause of the Hurons who quickly became the middlemen
in the fur trade between the French and the western Indians.</p>
<p>The Iroquois, who were farmers and hence controlled less land than
hunting tribes who were their neighbors, soon depleted their land of
fur bearing animals and began to plan acquisition of land held by nearby
tribes. At about this time the Dutch considerately gave the Iroquois
guns, and by this act unleashed what was probably the most potent Indian
military confederacy in North America upon the Hurons, who were
practically exterminated in an amazingly short time. The Erie, Tobacco
Nation, and Neutrals soon suffered the same fate as the Hurons.</p>
<p>The Algonkian tribes, attacked first by the Neutrals and then by
the victorious Iroquois, fled pell-mell into eastern Michigan and the
Sault area. Eventually most of these tribes either went around the southern
or the northern extremity of Lake Michigan to arrive in the relative
security of wilderness Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The exact dates for the arrival of these various dispossessed eastern
tribes are not certain. We do know that they probably came to Wisconsin
sometime after Nicolet&rsquo;s visit in 1634. The Mascouten, Potawatomi,
Kickapoo, Sauk, and Fox were coming into Wisconsin before 1654.
Some Huron and Ottawa settled here temporarily at this time, but by
1678 were compelled by the Sioux to flee back to the Sault. The Chippewa
stayed around and west of the Straits of Mackinac and actually did not
settle in Wisconsin until about 1670.</p>

</div>
<p>The Winnebago at first defended themselves vigorously against the
invading refugee tribes; however, this constant warfare greatly reduced
their numerical strength. Further decimated by plagues, probably smallpox
introduced by the whites, and by famine, the Winnebago were compelled
to make peace with the invading Algonkians who eventually settled
in great numbers along the Upper and Lower Fox rivers, the lower
reaches of the Wolf River, and in the vicinity of Green Bay.</p>
<p>Fur trade with the western Indians was successfully blocked by the
rampaging Iroquois for twenty odd years after Nicolet&rsquo;s voyage of exploration
into the Middlewest, but with the establishment of a brief
peace, the Ottawa, who had assumed the position of middlemen in the
fur trade, sent a large canoe fleet to the western Indians and soon returned
with large quantities of furs which had been accumulated by the
Indians during the Iroquois War.</p>
<p>On the return journey two young Frenchmen, Radisson and Groseilliers,
went into Wisconsin with the Ottawa and became the first known
white traders in the area. Other traders quickly followed their example,
and by 1670, the fur trade in Wisconsin was proceeding at a good pace.</p>
<p>The Indians, even before actually being visited by the whites, had
received European implements by trade with other Indians and soon
learned the superiority of iron knives and axes over those of stone.
The arrival of the white traders with their guns, kettles, cloth, brandy,
and many other trade items was eagerly awaited by the Indians of what
is now Wisconsin.</p>
<p>As early as 1668, Perrot and traders with him had brought furs to
Green Bay (La Baye). Great activity in the fur trade was quick to follow
with the French traders using guns and brandy particularly as an inducement
to increase the tempo of fur trapping by the Indian. The Indian
was as anxious to obtain the white man&rsquo;s goods as the trader was to
obtain the Indian&rsquo;s furs. This formed the basis for an understanding
mutually agreeable to Indian and trader alike.</p>
<p>The fur trade, during the French Regime, went through many changes
due to changing circumstances, and the issuing of different regulations
from time to time. The discovery of new western lands and tribes spurred
literally hundreds of Canadian youths to seek these virgin territories and
the riches in furs to be had there. At first traders persuaded the Indians
to make the long trip to Montreal with their furs. The presence of so
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
many traders in the forests, however, soon made these long trips unnecessary.
By the time Perrot began trading in Wisconsin the traders were
carrying their goods to the Indians in their own country.</p>
<p>Regulations required that all traders must be licensed, or buy <i>Conges</i>
as they were called. Twenty-five of these were issued each year and permitted
the trader to take a designated load of goods into the interior to be
traded for the Indian&rsquo;s furs. The presence of great numbers of unlicensed
traders in the woods was responsible for an edict from the king declaring
such illegal traders to be outlaws. The punishment for such activities
was death. These outlaw traders were known as <i>coureurs de bois</i> and were
actually never hampered too much by the stringent laws passed against
them.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the 17th century outposts were built to help
control the trade. Nicolas Perrot built posts at Mt. Trempealeau, at Lake
Pepin, and at the mouth of the Wisconsin River. The Sieur DuLhut
(Duluth) built posts in the Lake Superior region.</p>
<p>Since these terms are often misused, it might be best to briefly describe
the following occupations: A <i>bourgeois</i>, was an owner of goods and a

<p>The impact of the white man&rsquo;s civilization was bound to profoundly
change the life and geography of the Indians, and, particularly in the
early French period, this change was extremely rapid. Three groups were
actively working to institute changes in the Indian pattern of life. These
were the fur trader, whose goods revolutionized the material culture of
the natives, the Jesuit missionaries who hoped to convert the tribes to
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Christianity, and the French government itself, which attempted at various
times to relocate the tribes, form confederacies, and even to &ldquo;civilize&rdquo;
them.</p>
<p>The fur trader was the only one of the three groups who really succeeded
in materially changing the Indian&rsquo;s way of life, although his success was
unintentional. So completely did the materials of the white man replace
those of the Indian that within a few short generations almost no one
knew how to make stone tools and weapons, pottery vessels, bows and
arrows, and many other aboriginal products which were abandoned as
rapidly as superior goods of the whites were made available.</p>
<p>The change in tools and weapons naturally changed the Indians&rsquo; pattern
of life in many ways, but the entire economy of the tribes was
affected greatly by the fur trade. The Indian&rsquo;s need for the white man&rsquo;s
goods was great and he became more and more dependent upon the
trader. As the tempo of fur trading increased, the Indian began devoting
almost all of his time to hunting and trapping until, in a sense, he became
an employee in a great &ldquo;fur-trade factory&rdquo; with the goods he
received from the trader representing his wages. Much of the Indian&rsquo;s
old life of freedom gradually disappeared, since failure to obtain guns
or powder and bullets meant starvation for the Indian and his family.</p>

</div>
<p>Perhaps the worst effect of the contact between the Europeans and
the Indians was the introduction of brandy, always an effective persuader
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
in bargaining, and the introduction of European diseases, particularly
venereal disease and smallpox, the latter in some instances wiping out
entire tribes. The tendency for tribes to congregate around fur-trade
areas at the behest of the traders also had a detrimental effect upon the
Indians. In the Fox River valley and around Green Bay this overpopulation
resulted in famine and the voluntary exodus of some tribes before
1700, among them the Miami and some of the Kickapoo and Mascouten.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the adoption of new materials and living
habits was not entirely one-sided. The white man learned how to use the
Indian&rsquo;s birch-bark canoe, many of his foods, tobacco, moccasins, snow
shoes, and often buckskin clothing.</p>
<p>Both the Jesuits and the French military deliberately aimed at changing
the Indian&rsquo;s way of life but their aims were in direct opposition to
one another. The Jesuits were not interested in &ldquo;civilizing&rdquo; the Indians.
They desired to see these simple people maintained in their original
ignorance except for their belief in the &ldquo;One True God,&rdquo; and such simple
improvements in agriculture and other techniques as would improve their
lot as mission Indians. The Jesuits, not without some justification, regarded
contact between their charges and the French traders and soldiers
as having a demoralizing influence.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite great heroism and prodigious efforts on the part of the missionaries,
permanent effects on the Indians by the Jesuits was to prove
almost negligible. The Wisconsin Indian was highly war-like and found
it difficult to appreciate the humility preached by the missionary. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Indian regarded such behavior as effeminate.</p>

</div>
<p>Nevertheless, the story of their efforts to Christianize the tribes, and
the valor of these missionaries in exploring unknown territory, makes a
fascinating story in our state&rsquo;s history. Not the least among such heroic
deeds was the great voyage of exploration by Father Jacques Marquette
and Louis Joliet. Traveling up the Fox River, crossing over on foot at
what is now Portage, Wisconsin, and proceeding down the Wisconsin
River, the two explorers entered the Mississippi River on the seventeenth
of June, 1673. They explored the great river as far south as the Arkansas
River and then returned, by way of the Illinois River. This great discovery
made known a continuous water route from the Atlantic Ocean
to the Gulf of Mexico, and opened to the French the interior of a vast
continent.</p>
<p>It was the desire to exploit and unify this vast wilderness empire that
led the French leaders to attempt deliberate changes in the Wisconsin
Indian geography and political structure. This was necessary in order
to strengthen the Wisconsin tribes and keep them fighting the Iroquois
who consistently raided the western Indians and the French settlements
along the St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>LaSalle conceived the idea of a great Indian confederacy which, it was
hoped, would be able to successfully oppose the mighty Iroquois, and so
built forts in the Illinois country to help defend the area. The Wisconsin
Mascouten and Kickapoo left this area, partly because of their desire
to join the confederacy and partly because of population pressure in
the Fox River valley.</p>
<p>The year before the Iroquois invasions of 1680, DuLhut helped to
strengthen the French cause by negotiating peace between the Dakota
Sioux and their enemy of long standing, the Chippewa, and also reconciling
the Dakota Sioux and Assiniboine, who had been warring for
thirty years.</p>
<p>Nicolas Perrot probably was the most influential French officer ever to
have worked with the Wisconsin tribes. It was mainly through his constant
efforts that they were kept from going over to the Iroquois when the
tribes felt that the French had abandoned them. Perrot was probably the
only Frenchman to remain consistently on friendly terms with the Foxes,
who eventually were to engage the French in the bloodiest Indian war
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
ever to be fought on Wisconsin soil. Perrot constantly travelled from
village to village organizing raids against the Iroquois, raids which
eventually assisted in forcing the Iroquois to sue for peace. The French,
through the efforts of men like LaSalle, Perrot, and DuLhut, had once
again secured a firm hold on the western tribes, but the Iroquois warfare
of the 1680&rsquo;s had caused a slump in the fur trade. The trade was,
moreover, soon to receive a blow which was to almost completely kill
all official commerce between the Indians and the French for a number
of years. This was the issuance of a royal edict by the French King, May
21, 1696, revoking all fur trade licenses and prohibiting all colonials
from carrying goods to the western country.</p>
<p>There were really two main causes for the issuance of this edict. One
was a slump in the beaver market caused by the great flood of furs into
France and a decline in beaver hat production, due partly to the emigration
of the Huguenots who were the main hat felters; the other cause
for the edict was the anger of the Jesuits, aroused by the sale of brandy
to the Indians by the traders and soldiers.</p>
<p>It was hoped that the Indian tribes would make the journey to Montreal
themselves to trade their furs, but it was soon discovered that most
tribes either would not or could not make such a journey for purposes
of trade. The result, of course, was severe hardship for the Indians of
Wisconsin. Lack of gunpowder and lead restricted their hunting abilities
and made it more difficult for them to defend themselves against the
Iroquois and other hostile tribes. The Indians were becoming increasingly
dependent upon the French to the extent that they had lost much
of the freedom they had enjoyed as a self-sufficient people.</p>
<p>The rapid abandonment of the western posts followed the fur trade
ban. The commanders of these outposts, for the most part, did not consider
it worthwhile to stay on in that capacity if they could not enrich
themselves by means of the Indian trade.</p>
<p>Peace was finally arranged between the Iroquois and the French and
their Indian allies in 1700. The Iroquois had suffered heavily from the
raids by the western Indians. They claimed to have lost more than half
their warriors. With the fear of Iroquois raids ended, the confederacies
of western tribes quickly fell apart, and the latter turned to fighting
among themselves as they had always done in the past.</p>
<p>The French military now decided on a concentration policy. The
western posts were to be restricted to three main centers. These were
to be at Detroit, New Orleans, and near Tonty&rsquo;s post in the Illinois
country. Fairly large numbers of troops were stationed at these posts
to provide adequate defense, and the western tribes were to be concentrated
in these areas. This would facilitate the fur trade by permitting
the Indians to trap their furs and bring them directly to the trading
centers. The French government also hoped to &ldquo;civilize&rdquo; the Indians,
teaching them to farm the land, learn the French language, and eventually
even participate in the colonial economy.</p>
<p>The concentration policy was foredoomed to failure. The Wisconsin
tribes, of whom many were hereditary enemies, only needed a spark to set
them at one another&rsquo;s throats. This led to trouble at Detroit which
resulted in the bloody Fox Wars, long, costly fighting for the French
which contributed much towards their final downfall in the New World.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Events occurring in Wisconsin during the first half of the
Eighteenth Century were to bode little good for the French, and
were to contribute towards the final downfall of New France
at the hands of the British. For a good share of the years between 1701
and 1738 the French were to be largely occupied with the attempt to
subjugate the Fox Indians and their allies.</p>
<p>Not only were the expeditions against the Fox to prove costly to
the French, but the enmity of the Fox required shiftings of trade routes.
As an inevitable result, friction between the French and English
traders developed, since the Fox at times blocked both the Fox River
in Wisconsin and the Illinois River to the French traders. The determined
resistance of the Fox also prevented the fruition of French hopes
to dominate the western tribes and influence them to espouse the
French cause. Furthermore, the difficulty experienced by the French
military in conquering a relatively small group of Wisconsin Indians
did little to further French prestige among other western tribes.</p>
<p>The First Fox War was actually the result of the French concentration
policy. Within a few years after the founding of Detroit in 1701 by the
Sieur de Cadillac there were almost 6000 Indians in the vicinity of the
fort. The Fox, meanwhile, determined to prevent the carrying of guns
to their enemy, the Dakota Sioux, were halting French traders attempting
to proceed up the Fox River on their journey to the Sioux country
on the Upper Mississippi. A French fort in the Sioux country was also
abandoned after the loss of several men due to attacks by the Fox.</p>
<p>Cadillac, realizing the need for some measure to bring these warlike
tribesmen under control, in 1710 invited the Fox, along with the other
tribes resident around Green Bay, to come and reside near Detroit. At this
crucial time, when so much depended on the leadership of a Frenchman
experienced in handling the tribes, Cadillac, probably the most capable
Colonial officer of the times, was sent to Louisiana as governor of that
colony. The new commandant at Detroit had none of Cadillac&rsquo;s ability
with the Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The arrival of the Fox and their allies, the Kickapoo, Sauk, and Mascouten,
was the signal for trouble. These tribesmen were feared as well
as hated by the other Indians about Detroit. After a band of Mascouten
were attacked by the Ottawa near the St. Joseph River, during the winter
of 1711-1712, the Fox, in revenge, immediately attacked the Ottawa and
Huron at the Detroit post.</p>
<p>The Detroit commandant sided with the Ottawa and Huron and permitted
them to seek refuge in the French fort. Shortly after, the Fox
erected a stockade of their own and made preparations for a long fight.
The French and their allies were reinforced by a large band of Illinois,
Missouri, Osage, Potawatomi, and Menomini. This greatly superior force
laid siege to the Fox fort and the latter soon offered to surrender. The
French and their Indian supporters, however, were now determined to
completely exterminate their enemies.</p>
<p>After a siege of nineteen days, the Fox attempted to escape by taking
advantage of cover offered on a dark, rainy night. They were pursued,
overtaken, and the great majority of them were slaughtered. This was a
victory for the French, but a very costly one, for the Fox and their allies
still had a great many warriors in the forests of Wisconsin. These, in retaliation,
began a war of extermination against the allies of the French
who had participated in the Detroit massacre and the hunted tribesmen
soon complained that their people were starving because they dared not
hunt in the forests lest their men be slain by the vengeful Fox.</p>
<p>The summer of 1716 saw the first white army ever to invade the forests
of Wisconsin. The Sieur de Louvigny, in May of that year, left Montreal
with an army of several hundred French and a force of mission Indians
determined to compel the Fox to sue for peace. He arrived in Wisconsin
with his army augmented by western tribesmen, and <i>coureurs de bois</i> who
had been granted pardons for joining the expedition at their own expense.
With this total force amounting to about 800 men, Louvigny besieged
the fortified Fox village, situated near Little Lake Butte des Morts.
While the French kept up a fire with two small cannon and a grenade
mortar, they sank a trench towards the Fox fort determined to mine the
place and blow it up.</p>
<p>The Fox surrendered after three days of fighting and agreed to accept
terms which Louvigny thought very severe, but which his Indian allies
regarded as overmild. The terms included the requirement that the
Fox pay for the costs of the expedition against them by means of furs yet
to be gathered, to give up prisoners taken from the allies of the French,
to furnish a number of hostages to guarantee their future good behavior,
and to cede their territory to the French King.</p>
<p>The peace temporarily halted the bloody warfare of the four preceding
years and permitted the fur trade to be resumed. The concentration
policy had proven to be a failure, and shortly after the death of Louis
XIV, in 1715, the posts were once more occupied and the licensing system
for the fur trade was restored. A fort was built at La Baye (Green Bay)
in 1717, and a post was occupied at Chequamegon Bay to keep the Chippewa
from attacking the Fox and causing a resumption of war, and also
to regulate the fur trade in that area.</p>

<p class="pcap">EARLY FORT AT MICHILLIMACKINAC (MUSEUM MURAL BY GEORGE PETER).</p>
</div>
<p>The quite considerable friction between the colonies of Canada and
Louisiana provided the background for the events which led directly to
the Second Fox War. There was considerable argument as to the exact
boundaries of Illinois which now was annexed to Louisiana, although
originally settled by Canadians. The Fox took advantage of these feelings
of hostility by attacking the Illinois in the vicinity of Kaskaskia, even
killing Frenchmen in this area. The Fox claimed the Illinois would not
return Fox prisoners as they had promised according to treaty. The
Canadian governor, Vaudreuil, tended to side with the Fox in the argument.</p>
<p>After the death of Vaudreuil, his temporary successor, Baron de Longueuil
ordered the Sieur de Lignery, commandant at Mackinac, to enforce
a peace between the Fox, Kickapoo, and Mascouten, and their
enemies, the Illinois. The Fox promised to obey this demand, and in
order to ensure their obedience, a new post was built in the Sioux country.
This was rendered necessary by the fact that the Dakota Sioux had now
become allies of the Fox, and the French intended to make sure that
no aid would be coming to the Fox from that warlike tribe. The three
forts in the northwest, at Chequamegon Bay, La Baye, and on the upper
Mississippi in the Sioux country were to be maintained rather steadily
until near the end of the French regime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Fox chief Kiala had succeeded in forming an alliance
against the French between the Fox and their long-time allies the Kickapoo
and Mascouten, and a series of other tribes including, in addition
to the nearby Winnebago, such far distant tribes as the Abnaki and
Seneca in the East, and the Dakota Sioux, Missouri, Iowa, and Oto in
the West. Kiala hoped by this means to form a hostile circle about the
French which would end in their complete defeat, a plan similar to that
later attempted by Pontiac, and Tecumseh.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Beauharnois, appointed governor of Canada to replace
Vaudreuil, was determined that the raids on the Illinois and the
French at Kaskaskia must be stopped. A French army once more was
sent against the Fox. This time, headed by the Sieur de Lignery, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
expedition numbered about four hundred French and approximately
one thousand Indians. Warned by the Potawatomi, the Fox escaped
from their villages and the army arrived at each to find it deserted. At
Little Lake Butte des Morts the soldiers refused to go farther and Lignery
had to be satisfied with the burning of the Fox and Winnebago villages
and their stores of food.</p>
<p>Despite the poor showing of Lignery&rsquo;s expedition against the Fox,
Kiala&rsquo;s confederacy began to fall apart. Even their old allies, the Mascouten
and Kickapoo, were persuaded by the French to turn against them,
and the Sioux, closely watched by the French, no longer could give the
Fox refuge in their country. Discouraged by these losses and defeated
by the French under the capable Paul Marin, the Fox decided to flee
to the Iroquois country. The Fox had long been secretly treating with the
English and the Seneca, a member tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy
and hoped to find a friendly reception in their country.</p>
<p>Warned by the Mascouten and Kickapoo regarding the plans of the
Fox, French officers from nearby posts hastily gathered together Indian
allies and prepared to attack their fleeing enemies. The Fox, warned by
their scouts of the force advancing against them, hastily erected a stockade
and prepared to fight for their lives. They managed to fight off the besiegers
for twenty-three days. Then on a stormy night they attempted
flight but were quickly overtaken. Almost all of the band were either
slaughtered or taken as slaves.</p>
<p>After the few survivors of this disaster, seeking refuge in their village
near the mouth of the Wisconsin River, were attacked by Detroit Indians,
Kiala and three other chiefs offered to give themselves up, asking
mercy for themselves and the fifty surviving warriors, supposedly all that
were left of the entire tribe. De Villiers accepted the surrender and
hastened to Montreal with his prisoners. De Villiers was ordered to
return and kill off the rest of the Fox, taking only the women and children
as prisoners. These were to be sold into slavery, like Kiala, who was fated
to end his days as a slave in the West Indies.</p>
<p>De Villiers returned to the Sauk village at Green Bay and demanded
that the Sauk release the remnant of Fox survivors. The Sauk declined
to release warriors with whom they had strong blood ties, and in an
attempt to force an entrance, one of de Villiers&rsquo; sons was killed. The
French quickly retaliated and in the exchange of fire de Villiers himself
was killed by a twelve year old boy, who later became renowned as the
Sauk Chief Blackbird. In the battle that followed, the Sieur Duplessis,
the Sieur de Repentigny, and six other Frenchmen quickly met the same
fate. The Sauk and Fox, too, lost heavily and fled to the vicinity of the
present-day city of Menasha. The bloody battle that ensued there, it is
said, accounts for the name Butte des Morts, or Hill of the Dead.</p>
<p>As a result of this battle, the remainder of the Fox and the Sauk amalgamated
and for all practical purposes became one tribe. They fled into
Iowa where they erected a new fort, and gradually their ranks were swelled
by Fox released from captivity by tribes now secretly in sympathy with
the Sauk and Fox. One more expedition was sent against them, led by
the Sieur de Noyelles, but although he followed the Sauk and Fox to the
vicinity of the Des Moines River, they were so well entrenched that it
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
was impossible to dislodge them and the expedition returned home without
success. Eventually the Fox Wars were brought to an end through a
policy of conciliation inaugurated in 1740 by Paul Marin, the new
commandant at La Baye. Force had, in the long run, proven a failure
in the campaign to completely subjugate the Fox.</p>

<p class="pcap">SAUK AND FOX CHIEF (FROM GEO. CATLIN).</p>
</div>
<p>Throughout the first half of the Eighteenth Century the French, as
we have seen, had been occupied with more or less constant warfare with
the Fox. This warfare was the dominant note in the history of Wisconsin
for this period, and in general, the role of other Wisconsin tribes during
this era was that of serving as allies either of the French or of the Fox.</p>
<p>The failure of Noyelles&rsquo; expedition against the Fox had helped to
lower French prestige among the western tribes, and in 1736 the Sioux,
angered by French friendship for the Chippewa and Cree, murdered a
French officer, a priest, and a party of nineteen <i>voyageurs</i>. From this
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
time on the Sioux could no longer be numbered among the allies of the
French. By 1739, the Sioux-Chippewa War flamed into action and the
Sioux were driven westward from the areas in Wisconsin now held by
the Chippewa.</p>
<p>Warfare between the English and the French in America again was
to seriously affect the western tribes. This conflict, lasting from 1744 to
1748, saw the fur trade with the western tribes reach extremely low proportions.
Goods were very scarce due to the loss of French ships at the
hands of British fighting vessels, and this failure to produce sufficient
goods for the Indians, in addition to the already declining prestige of
the French, encouraged some of the western tribes to seek more favorable
relations with the British. Most of the Huron, under Chief Nicolas, began
trading with the British, and many other western tribes exhibited the
same inclination.</p>
<p>The end of the current conflict with the English enabled the French
to regain control of these tribes, but the Miami had moved into Ohio and
established a large village called Pickawillany which became a fairly
permanent camp for a number of English traders. Several expeditions
against this village by the French failed. In 1752, however, Charles de
Langlade, later famed as one of Wisconsin&rsquo;s pioneer French settlers at
Green Bay, who was part French and part Ottawa and who thus had
tremendous influence among the Indians, led an expedition against Pickawillany
which enjoyed remarkable success. The village was destroyed,
the English traders captured, and the Miami returned to French
allegiance.</p>
<p>For a while France again enjoyed supremacy in the West. In 1755,
Langlade and his contingent of Wisconsin and Mackinac braves participated
in the famous battle culminating in &ldquo;Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat&rdquo;. Chippewa,
Menomini, Potawatomi, and Winnebago were said to be present
at this engagement, and for many years thereafter trophies of this battle
were to be found in Wisconsin Indian lodges. Despite this severe defeat
of the British and American Colonials, the fortunes of the French were
destined to take a turn for the worse. By 1761, Wisconsin was under
British control, and in 1763, France formally surrendered the rest of
her American possessions to England. She had ceded Louisiana to Spain
the year before.</p>
<p>Much had happened to Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians during this period, roughly
from 1700 to 1760. The long and bloody Fox Wars had wrought hardship
on the other tribes as well as on the Fox. The Sioux-Chippewa war had
resulted in the Sioux being forced to relinquish most of their Wisconsin
territory to the Chippewa. The Potawatomi Indians, who had fought
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
under Langlade and participated in the killing of the unarmed English
and Americans at Fort William Henry, were visited by a grim vengeance
in the form of smallpox, contracted from the English soldiers and brought
back by the tribes to their own country where it raged virtually unchecked.
Great numbers of Indians lost their lives as a result.</p>
<p>Other tribes left Wisconsin, some never to return. The Kickapoo and
Mascouten were now in Illinois and Indiana. The Potawatomi were
below Lake Michigan at St. Joseph. Thus many of the tribes here
when the French traders and missionaries first arrived, no longer were
in the Wisconsin scene. The tribes remaining here were destined to know
new masters, the British, who were to control the fur trade in Wisconsin
until the end of the War of 1812.</p>

<p class="pcap">PONTIAC.</p>
</div>
<p>British military control of Wisconsin was ushered in with the
arrival of Ensign James Gorrell at Green Bay on the twelfth of
October, 1761. With the aid of his two non-commissioned officers
and fifteen privates, Gorrell set about to restore the old French fort
which he renamed Fort Edward Augustus, in honor of the Duke of
York. His next task was to win over the French <i>habitants</i> about the fort
and to gain the sympathy of the Indians in the area for the British cause.
Apparently Gorrell was quite successful in both tasks.</p>
<p>The French <i>habitants</i> about the posts taken over by the British found
it rather easy, for the most part, to transfer their allegiance to the British
Crown since they were given the same privileges they enjoyed under
French authority. Moreover, the British traders found it more advantageous
to form partnerships with the more experienced French traders
than to attempt to supersede them.</p>
<p>British success with the Indians varied according to local conditions
at the different forts. The British were not inclined to give presents as
liberally as the French had done, and it was not British policy to fraternize
or intermarry with their savage allies. The feeling of inferiority
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
prompted by this treatment caused resentment among many tribes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="923" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">TRADERS PORTAGING (PAINTING BY T. LINDBERG).</p>
</div>
<p>In central Wisconsin, however, Gorrell&rsquo;s diplomatic treatment of the
Indians, added to the fact that the Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, and Menomini
held a certain amount of resentment towards the French, swung these
tribes over to the British. The promises of medals and commissions to the
Indian chiefs, and the fact that the British trade goods were cheaper by
far than those offered by the French, also tended to offset the more arrogant
treatment of the tribes by the British.</p>
<p>Gorrell&rsquo;s success with the Indians of central Wisconsin was very important
to Wisconsin history, for in 1763 the British were compelled to
deal with a widespread Indian uprising largely led by Pontiac, chief of
an Ottawa tribe from around the Straits of Mackinac, and one of the most
able Indian leaders who ever lived. It was Pontiac&rsquo;s plan to drive all
the British and Colonials into the sea by means of an alliance of Indian
tribes from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River, and from the Ohio
River to the Great Lakes. Pontiac&rsquo;s chief claim to greatness lies in his
remarkable feat of keeping a number of tribes together for a seven-month
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
siege of Detroit, a unique event in Indian warfare.</p>
<p>In addition to the attack on Detroit, concerted attacks were made on
other British posts, of which a number fell, including the one at Mackinac.
The failure of the Indians to take Forts Detroit, Pitt, and Niagara
assured defeat for Pontiac&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>On June 2, 1763, the Chippewa Indians took Fort Mackinac by a
clever subterfuge. They faked a game of LaCrosse in front of the stockade
and pretended accidentally to knock the ball into the fort. As the players
rushed after the ball they seized guns from the watching Indian women
who had concealed the weapons under their blankets. Most of the garrison
was massacred before they had a chance to defend themselves.</p>
<p>The loyalty to the British of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, and
Menomini Indians, and the timely arrival of a delegation of Sioux, sworn
enemies of the Chippewa, probably saved Green Bay from a similar fate.</p>
<p>Etherington hastily summoned Gorrell to his assistance. Gorrell abandoned
Fort Edward Augustus at Green Bay and with the aid of 90 men
of the Sauk, Fox, Menomini, and Winnebago tribes succeeded in obtaining
the prisoners&rsquo; release from the Indians. The party then proceeded on to
Montreal. British military occupation of Wisconsin was not resumed
until the War of 1812.</p>
<p>The Pontiac rebellion also served to bring the problems relating to
the Indians home to the British Government and probably helped as an
incentive to the issuance of the Proclamation of 1763. British subjects
were now forbidden to purchase lands west of the Appalachian mountains
without special license. It was hoped that this would prevent further
encroachments by white settlers upon Indian lands. Trade with the
Indians was to be permitted where licenses with the various colonial
governments had been procured. Moreover, since Wisconsin was not included
in the limits of any of the colonies, Wisconsin was left without
any government other than that exercised by the military at Mackinac.
This matter was not rectified until 1774 when the Quebec Act placed
Wisconsin under the authority of the Governor of Canada.</p>
<p>Mackinac became the seat of Wisconsin&rsquo;s fur trade when the fort was
rebuilt there in 1764. It was the only fort northwest of Detroit with
government officers and Indian agents. By 1767, large numbers of traders
were coming into the Wisconsin area. The Indians by this time were so
dependent on the white trader that any interruption in the supply of
goods flowing to the Indians worked severe hardships upon them.</p>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s fur trade was still largely controlled by Montreal investors,
mostly British. The actual traders, however, who contacted the Indians
were still primarily Frenchmen, and this was to remain so throughout
Wisconsin&rsquo;s fur-trade period. Some competition in Wisconsin was given
to the British by Spanish and French traders from Louisiana, which had
become Spanish territory by the peace treaty in 1763. But the British
managed to retain the bulk of the northwest fur trade with the Indians.</p>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians did not participate strongly in the American Revolution,
but they did take part in some action. Charles de Langlade, half
French, half Ottawa Indian leader who helped the French so efficiently
during the French and Indian War, now espoused the British cause as
ardently as he had the French. Langlade&rsquo;s tremendous influence over
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the Indians was well known, and the British hoped to persuade him to
obtain Wisconsin Indian help in fighting the Colonists. Langlade did
succeed in leading Chippewa and Ottawa east to help Burgoyne in 1777,
and in 1778 Wisconsin Indians went to Detroit to help General Hamilton.
On the whole, however, Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians were too disinterested in
the white man&rsquo;s war to be enthusiastic about long trips east to aid the
British.</p>

<p>The American Revolutionary War hero, Major George Rogers Clark,
whose capture of Vincennes and Kaskaskia, and the French villages of the
Illinois country, provided the basis for United States claims to the
Northwest Territory during the peace negotiations between the British
and the United States, called together a great assembly of Indians at
Cahokia, Illinois, in 1778, and succeeded in obtaining their pledges of
allegiance to the United States. Many Wisconsin Indians attended the
meeting, including the noted Blackbird, chief of a Milwaukee village
composed of Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi. Blackbird apparently
remained loyal to the American cause. Major Clark&rsquo;s influence with
the Wisconsin Indians tended to nullify the efforts of Charles Langlade,
and other French officers in the service of England, to mobilize the Wisconsin
Indians against the United States.</p>
<p>In 1780, England utilized some Wisconsin Indians in an attack on the
Spanish with whom she was then at war. Twelve hundred warriors were
assembled at Prairie du Chien, and marched on St. Louis. Aided by the
fact that they had advance knowledge of the enemy movements, that
some of the tribesmen were more or less sympathetic with the American
cause, and that the Indians showed no enthusiasm for attacking in the
face of cannon fire, the Spanish and Americans succeeded in routing the
attackers. After this action Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians were not involved in any
important campaigns during the remaining years of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>British control of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians did not cease with the end of
the Revolutionary War. Despite the British agreement in the Treaty of
Paris, in 1783, to turn over their posts at Niagara, Detroit, and Michillimackinac,
they continued to hold these forts until after the Jay Treaty
of 1794. It was not until October, 1796, that Mackinac, the last post to be
turned over by the British, was officially occupied by American troops.
The British, however, still maintained their control over Wisconsin&rsquo;s
Indians through the fur trade now operating from posts just across the
Canadian border.</p>
<p>Within a month after the declaration of war against England by the
American Congress in 1812, Mackinac was retaken by the British and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Menomini and Winnebago Indians from Wisconsin. Among the Menomini
were chiefs Tomah and Oshkosh, the latter destined to become a
famous Menomini leader and friend of the Americans. Within another
month Fort Dearborn (at Chicago) was attacked by Indians and most of
its civilian and military inhabitants massacred. Menomini, Potawatomi,
and Winnebago Indians from Wisconsin took part in this attack.</p>

<p class="pcap">MENOMINI WARRIOR (FROM INDIAN TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA).</p>
</div>
<p>The Americans were well aware of the strategic importance of Prairie
du Chien in any attempt to control Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians. In June, 1814,
Fort Shelby, probably the first building over which an American flag
ever flew in Wisconsin, was erected at this strategic location. Lt. Perkins
and sixty men were left in charge at the fort.</p>
<p>The British quickly determined to drive out the Americans and succeeded
in forcing Perkins to surrender the fort on July 19, 1814. About
500 Indians, mostly Menomini, Chippewa, Winnebago, and Sioux, took
part in the assault on the American post.</p>
<p>The British renamed the post Fort McKay and managed to hold it
against the Americans until, in agreement with the Treaty of Ghent,
they finally abandoned the fort in May, 1815, and British control of Wisconsin&rsquo;s
Indians was finally at an end. The fate of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians
was now in the hands of the United States Government.</p>

<br />THE PERIOD OF AMERICAN SETTLEMENT</h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians, under the French and British had
become increasingly dependent upon the white man. Without
the invaders&rsquo; tools, weapons, utensils, and various other things
which the Indian had come to depend upon, he found himself unable to
supply himself with the necessities of life. The French and British traders,
of course, were interested almost exclusively in procuring furs from the
Indians, and as long as the aborigines could obtain furs for them, the
traders would supply their needs.</p>
<p>The Americans, however, were primarily interested in exploiting and
settling the Indians&rsquo; land; fur trading was secondary. As they pushed
into the new territory in ever increasing numbers, first to exploit the lead
mines of southwestern Wisconsin, and then to farm the fertile soil, the
Indian was doomed to be relentlessly pushed aside. He had lost his independence.
Now he was to lose his land and the very means of his livelihood.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Americans upon the Wisconsin scene pleased neither
the Indians nor the French traders. Both relied to a great extent on the
fur trade, and they knew that the clearing of land by the settlers would
hasten the end of this activity. Many of the French, too, had Indian blood
and considered their cause as one with the Indians. The United States
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
government first showed poor judgment in its attempt to make these
people conform to American standards. For example, the French and Indians
were warned that common-law marriages between the two races
would no longer be tolerated, but must be legalized by either a civil or
church ceremony, and violators would face punishment. Both the French
and Indians bitterly fought what seemed to them oppression, and eventually
later decisions recognized the legality of common-law unions of
earlier regimes.</p>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indian agents were for a time under the authority of two
superintendents of Indian affairs. Lewis Cass, Governor of Michigan
Territory, of which Wisconsin was a part from 1818 to 1836, was in charge
of the Indian agent at Green Bay. The agent at Prairie du Chien worked
under the direction of William Clark who, as Superintendent of St.
Louis from 1807 to 1838, had authority to the source of the Mississippi
River. These agents distributed annuities and payments due the Indians
and attempted to keep white settlers from squatting on Indian land.
The settlers, however, rudely took over Indian land and, in the inevitable
conflict that followed, the militia and army would be called out to protect
the whites. In the ensuing &ldquo;peace treaty&rdquo; the Indians would be forced
to cede their lands and move westward.</p>

<p class="pcap">INVADING SETTLERS (PAINTING BY A. O. TIEMANN).</p>
</div>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s early territorial period was also the era of the frontier
fort manned by the regular U. S. Army. Since the pay for the ordinary
soldier was very small, the army attracted men who could not succeed
elsewhere, or immigrants who wished to desert at the first opportunity
and travel westward. The officers, however, were of different character
entirely. Educated at West Point, they were by far the most educated
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
and cultured men in the frontier settlements. With their wives, they represented
the cream of Wisconsin society of this period.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE ENFORCING OF LEGAL MARRIAGE (PAINTING BY A. O. TIEMANN).</p>
</div>
<p>Wisconsin had three main forts along the Fox-Wisconsin waterway.
Fort Howard was erected at Green Bay in 1816, the same year that Fort
Crawford was established at Prairie du Chien. Fort Winnebago was built
at what is now Portage in 1828, shortly after the Red Bird rebellion.
The United States army did its best to maintain peace between the Indians
and whites, and to protect the Indians from unlicensed traders, and
sometimes legitimate ones, who illegally sold whiskey to them. In their
efforts in this direction they often found themselves in conflict with civil
authorities who sometimes protected the traders apprehended in such
violations.</p>
<p>The fur trade continued in Wisconsin while the population was primarily
Indian, but by 1835 it was no longer of any significance in this
area. Following the War of 1812, the United States Government set up
fur trade &ldquo;factories&rdquo; at Prairie du Chien and Green Bay, hoping by this
means to control some of the evils, one of the most vicious of which was
the peddling of whiskey to the Indians. The whiskey was usually diluted
with water, and adulterants such as turpentine, or even corrosive acids,
added to restore the &ldquo;bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The government entry into the fur trade was unsuccessful. The factors,
as the proprietors of the trade &ldquo;factories&rdquo; were called, lacked experience
in dealing with the Indians. They did not give credit advancements
to them as did the other traders, and the American Fur Company
applied pressure on Congress to end this system. Gradually this Company
acquired the fur trade monopoly in this area; Solomon Juneau,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Milwaukee&rsquo;s famous founder, was one of the American Fur Company&rsquo;s
agents in what is now the State of Wisconsin. The gradual decadence of
the fur trade, of course, increased the hardships of Wisconsin tribes.</p>

<p>As settlers began encroaching on the Indians&rsquo; land, conflicts were inevitable.
John C. Calhoun, the Secretary of War in 1825, sponsored a plan
for the removal of eastern tribes across the Mississippi to the western
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
plains. It was believed that by furnishing them with equipment for hunting
and farming they could survive readily and would be safe from further
pressure by white homesteaders. No one realized at this time how
soon these western lands would be overrun by the relentless pressure of
the American pioneer. The land purchased from the Indians was to be
made available to American settlers. The lands of certain tribes of Wisconsin
Indians were to be included in this overall plan.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">SOLOMON JUNEAU, AGED 60.</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately for the smooth functioning of this operation, the Indians
did not care to leave the land on which they and their ancestors
had hunted for so long a time, and travel to new hunting grounds. In
many instances they were not removed without a show of force, sometimes
with considerable blood being shed by both whites and Indians.</p>
<p>In 1825, Lewis Cass and William Clark held a conference of Wisconsin
tribes at Prairie du Chien. They hoped to establish definite boundaries
for the holdings of the different tribes in order to eliminate friction
between them. This would also facilitate future land purchases from the
Indians. Roughly these boundaries were recognized: the southwest and
southeast corners of Wisconsin were allotted to the southern Chippewa,
Ottawa, and Potawatomi; the Winnebago held the remainder of southern
Wisconsin; the Menomini kept the northeast part of the state from the
Milwaukee River up; and the Chippewa held all of northern Wisconsin
west of the Menomini. These Indian territories were not to be respected
for very long by white squatters, however, and the Winnebago were to be
among the first to encounter trouble from this source.</p>
<p>The fact that southwestern Wisconsin was very rich in lead was discovered
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
quite early in the French regime, and it is probable that the
French taught the Indians how to mine and smelt the ore. By 1811, the
Sauk and Fox are reported to have devoted almost all their attention
to lead mining, only hunting to supply themselves with meat. They exchanged
the metal with Canadian traders for the goods they needed.
Some early American traders who attempted to get in on this trade were
killed by the Indians, who feared that once the Americans learned of
the value of the lead deposits their cupidity would be aroused and the
Indians would lose their land. Later events were to prove the excellence
of this reasoning.</p>
<p>Aroused by the rich deposits, Cornish miners, particularly, began to
arrive in force by 1827. The Indians were rudely expelled from their
diggings and their mines appropriated by armed whites. In the same
year, Red Bird, a young Winnebago chief, killed two settlers and scalped
a baby who, interestingly enough, survived to become the mother of a
large family and live to a ripe old age. Following this attack Red Bird
and his warriors, about forty in number, celebrated the scalp taking with
a drunken carousal at the mouth of the Bad Axe River, about forty miles
north of Prairie du Chien. Two keelboats on their way from Fort Snelling
to St. Louis were fired upon by the drunken Winnebago braves, and
after a battle of about three hours, the keelboats escaped with a loss of
four men dead and several wounded. The Indians were reported to have
suffered losses of seven dead and fourteen wounded.</p>

<p>United States troops rapidly arrived at the scene, and after fleeing up
the Wisconsin River, Red Bird found himself and his tribe surrounded.
The Americans agreed to forget the matter of the keelboats providing the
murderers of the settlers would give themselves up for trial. On Sept. 3,
1827, Red Bird, rather than engage his people in a hopeless war against
the whites, voluntarily surrendered to Major Whistler at Portage. Arrangements
were made for the Americans to use the lead mines until a treaty
could be arranged, and in July, 1829, another Grand Council was held
at Prairie du Chien. The Winnebago, southern Potawatomi, Chippewa,
and Ottawa agreed to cede their land. The United States Government
now owned the rich lead mining country of southwestern Wisconsin.</p>

<p class="pcap">WINNEBAGO CHIEF (PORTRAIT BY S. M. BROOKS).</p>
</div>
<p>During this period of American settlement, beginning as early as 1821
and lasting through 1834, a migration of Indians from New York occurred
which was to add some permanent residents to Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indian
population. The Oneida and Munsee settled near Green Bay, and the
Stockbridge and Brotherton Indians settled along the eastern shore of
Lake Winnebago. The Menomini ceded 500,000 acres of their land to
these tribes in 1831.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the stage had been set for what was to become the most
famous, and also, perhaps, the most infamous Indian and white conflict
in the Wisconsin area. This was the so-called Black Hawk War, although
it was more of a systematic extermination of Indians by whites, hardly
deserving the term &ldquo;war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Hawk was leader of the &ldquo;British band&rdquo; of the Sauk with a large
village, said to number about 500 families, situated near the mouth of the
Rock River in Illinois. His people were known as the &ldquo;British band&rdquo;
because of their known sympathies with the English, and also since
Black Hawk and his warriors had fought with Tecumseh and the British
against the Americans in the War of 1812.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>White settlers began squatting on Black Hawk&rsquo;s land as early as 1823,
despite the fact that according to treaty the Indians were not required to
give up their land until land offices had been set up, an event which had
not occurred. The Indians&rsquo; cornfields were fenced in, wigwams were
burned, and the women mistreated. Black Hawk went to the British
agent in Canada, near Detroit. He was advised that the treaties of 1804
and 1816 were being violated and that he rightfully could resist the
settlers and expect the backing of the United States Government. Black
Hawk returned and warned the settlers that they would be attacked
unless they left at once.</p>

<p class="pcap">I-TWA-KU-AM, MOHICAN LEADER (PORTRAIT BY HAMLIN).</p>
</div>
<p>The alarmed settlers sought help from the Illinois militia which was
rapidly called to arms in 1831. This show of force compelled Black Hawk
to retire to the west side of the Mississippi River with his people, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
promise not to return without government permission. Chief Keokuk,
head of the combined Sauk and Fox tribes, had already taken all of his
people, except the rebellious Black Hawk and his band, into what is now
Iowa in 1830, realizing the futility of fighting the tremendously superior
white forces.</p>

<img src="images/p24a.jpg" alt="" width="841" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">BLACK HAWK (FROM INDIAN TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA).</p>
</div>
<p>On April 6, 1832, Black Hawk crossed back into Illinois with approximately
1000 of his people, about 400 of whom were warriors. He had been
promised aid by emissaries of the Potawatomi, Winnebago, Ottawa, and
Chippewa, but before a month had passed Black Hawk realized he would
get little aid either from these tribes or from the British in a war against
the settlers. The militia had been called out again in the meantime, and
Black Hawk now only desired to make peace and get his people back to
Iowa. He sent messengers under a white flag to Major Stillman who was
encamped nearby with about 400 volunteers. The white flag was ignored,
and three of the Indians were killed. Black Hawk had only forty warriors
with him at the time, but angered by this treachery, he attacked
Stillman&rsquo;s men in what he himself called a &ldquo;suicide charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tremendously superior force of volunteers, upon seeing Black
Hawk&rsquo;s charging braves, fled frantically with the first volley fired by the
Indians. As they fled they spread the alarm over most of northern Illinois,
and maintained that Black Hawk had ambushed them with 2000 warriors.
Following this event Black Hawk removed his women and children to the
Lake Koshkonong area in Wisconsin, so that they could forage for desperately
needed food and be relatively safe from attack. Black Hawk
and his warriors spent the following two months attacking settlements
along the Wisconsin-Illinois frontier. Two hundred whites and possibly
as many Indians were killed in these border skirmishes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Black Hawk soon found himself pursued by a greatly superior force of
militia and regular U. S. Army troops. He and his band fled through the
Madison, Wisconsin, area and were overtaken attempting to cross the Wisconsin
River, where the Battle of Wisconsin Heights took place on July
21, 1832. Black Hawk&rsquo;s braves succeeded in holding back the Americans
while the tribe crossed the river, and the following morning one of his
men made a surrender speech in the Winnebago language. No one in
the American camp understood the plea for surrender terms, since the
Winnebago followers of the Americans were not in their camp at the
time. The Indians were again compelled to flee.</p>
<p>Black Hawk then divided his people into two groups, one of which
obtained rafts and canoes from friendly Winnebago, and proceeded
down the Wisconsin River, hoping to reach the Mississippi River and
cross back to Iowa. Soldiers from Prairie du Chien captured or shot
most of them. Some others were hunted down in the woods by Menomini
Indians led by white officers. As the rest of Black Hawk&rsquo;s band fled overland
toward the Mississippi River, they were pursued by the combined
forces of General Atkinson, General Henry, and Major Dodd, a total force
of some four thousand men.</p>
<p>When Black Hawk&rsquo;s band arrived at the Mississippi River, they were
met by the steamboat &ldquo;Warrior.&rdquo; Black Hawk again attempted to surrender,
but the &ldquo;Warrior&rsquo;s&rdquo; captain preferred to believe this a trick and
opened fire on the Indians. The infantry then arrived and attacked the
Indians from the rear. Men, women, and children were forced into the
river at bayonet point. Many were drowned as they attempted to swim
the river, and others were picked off by American sharpshooters from
the shore. This was the massacre of the Bad Axe River, which lasted three
hours, and in which 150 Indians were killed and as many more drowned.
A band of Sioux, brought there for the purpose by General Atkinson,
set upon the 300 Indians who reached the other bank and killed about
half of them.</p>
<p>Only about 150 survivors remained of the thousand Indians who had
crossed with Black Hawk into Illinois in April only four months before.</p>
<p>Black Hawk fled to the Winnebago, who later surrendered him to the
Americans. He was then taken on a tour through the eastern states to
impress him with the power of the American Government, and released
in June, 1833. His tribe was given a small reservation in Iowa on the
Des Moines River, where he died October 3, 1838. The treatment of
Black Hawk and his people in the so-called &ldquo;Black Hawk War&rdquo; will
always remain a blot on American history and a discredit to the Government.</p>
<p>From the time of the &ldquo;Black Hawk War&rdquo; on, Wisconsin Indians were
rapidly deprived of their land. In September, 1832, the Winnebago ceded
the rest of their holdings south and east of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers.
Upon promise of payment of about one million dollars to the Indians
and their creditors, the southern Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi, in
a treaty at Chicago, Illinois, turned over their holdings in southern Wisconsin
in 1833. The Menomini ceded almost four million acres between
Green Bay and the Wolf River to the United States Government in 1836.
In 1838, the Oneida ceded most of their land in this same area to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
United States. The Chippewa, Sioux, and Winnebago, in three separate
treaties, ceded the western half of Wisconsin, above the Wisconsin River,
in 1837. With the final cession of some small holdings of the Menomini
in the east central part of the state, in 1848, the United States Government
now had possession of all Indian land in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The Indians, in most cases, had western lands assigned to them. The
United States army forcibly removed many Winnebago to Nebraska,
some of whom remain there today. Other Winnebago, homesick for
Wisconsin and afraid of the Sioux, gradually wandered back to Wisconsin
where they still are. In 1854 the Menomini were placed on a reservation
on the Upper Wolf River. Shortly after this, they sold two townships
to the Stockbridge Indians. In 1854, also, three large reservations:
Lac Court Oreilles, Lac du Flambeau, and Bad River, were assigned to the
Chippewa.</p>

<p>In considering the story of those Indians who were important
in the history of our state, we have seen that from time to time some
tribes have left the Wisconsin scene. We might well wonder what
has been their final fate and where they may be found today. As we remember
the United States Government removal plan, we are not too surprised
to find many of them located at reservations and agencies in our
western United States.</p>
<p>The Sauk and Fox are at agencies in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma.
The Sauk and Fox reservation in Iowa has an Indian population of 473,
and there are 129 Sauk and Fox at the Kansas reservation and an additional
910 at the Sauk and Fox reservation at the Shawnee agency in
Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The Kickapoo have small reservations in Oklahoma and Kansas. The
Indian population at the Kickapoo reservation in Oklahoma numbers
269; and at the Kickapoo reservation in Kansas, 343. In addition, there
are some 350 Kickapoo living in the state of Coahuila, Mexico, having
split off from the Oklahoma band in 1852. Population figures given
here for the Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo are from the estimates of the Office
of Indian Affairs of the United States Department of the Interior for
the year 1940.</p>
<p>The present whereabouts of the Mascoutens presents somewhat of
a mystery. Most students of the subject at present believe that members
of the Prairie Band of the Potawatomi, who also call themselves the
Mascoutens, are the descendents of that tribe, which is so often referred
to in early Wisconsin history. The early Mascoutens were closely related
to the Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo, according to early reports, in language
and culture, and usually were the political allies of these tribes as well.
Some bands of the Prairie Potawatomi are found associated with the
Kickapoo in Oklahoma and Kansas, and also in Mexico.</p>
<p>As for the Santee Sioux, who were in northern Wisconsin even before
the arrival of the white man, it is again difficult to give accurate present
population figures. The term Santee originally designated one band of
Indians, but eventually came to mean all of the forest bands of the
Sioux, of whom, in all probability, many never resided in Wisconsin.
There are, according to the 1940 estimate, 1,197 Sioux living on the Santee
reservation in Nebraska, and there are 585 Sioux in Minnesota who
would be included in the Santee division. If we were to include all tribes
generally classed as Santee Sioux today, expressed in round numbers, 5,000
would probably be a conservative estimate. However, many of these are
not derived from those bands formerly living in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Returning to the Wisconsin scene today, we learn from the 1940 estimates
of the Office of Indian Affairs that the present Indian population
in Wisconsin is 13,678. Of this total, 5,605 are Chippewa, residing at the
Bad River, Lac Court Oreilles, Lac du Flambeau, and Red Cliff reservations.
Also included in this figure are the Mole Lake Chippewa and the
St. Croix band.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE CHIPPEWA STILL PREPARE BUCK-SKIN.</p>
</div>
<p>Included in Wisconsin&rsquo;s present Indian population are also 2,454
Menomini, located at their reservation in Shawano County; 460 Stockbridge
and Munses, on their reservation adjoining that of the Menomini;
1,700 Oneida, scattered around the village of Oneida, 10 miles southwest
of Green Bay; 1,498 Winnebago, on public domain land allotments, primarily
in Jackson, Wood, and Shawano counties; and 310 Potawatomi,
in Forest County. While only a small number of Potawatomi have returned
to this state since their removal, over half of the Winnebago are
now back in their Wisconsin homeland. In addition to the Winnebago
who returned to Wisconsin after their removal by the United States Army,
1,268 remained at their reservation in Nebraska. Thus of this reportedly
numerous and powerful tribe first encountered by the French when
Nicolet landed near Green Bay, in 1634, about 2,766 still survive.</p>

</div>
<p>The future status of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Indians presents a considerable problem
to the United States Government. Their life on reservations is hardly
an easy one for the majority. Even among the Menomini, whose tribal
lumbering industry makes them economically the most prosperous in
the state, the standard of living is not high. Finding a means whereby
they can earn a decent living is probably the greatest difficulty. For the
most part they suffer for lack of adequate clothing and food, particularly
during the winter season. To alleviate the situation, a considerable number
have migrated to the cities to obtain employment, and there are an
estimated one thousand Indians living in Milwaukee, for example, of
which the largest group is Oneida.</p>
<p>So far no satisfactory solution to the problem has been reached, although
some sincere attempts have been made in that direction. The
hope, of course, is that eventually the Indians will be assimilated by the
rest of our population and be able to live normal lives as United States
citizens. Without intelligently directed help this process will take a long
time, and during that period the Indians will continue to suffer.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Indians of today are acculturated to a greater or lesser
degree: among the Chippewa, Potawatomi, Menomini, and Winnebago
a considerable amount of the traditional culture survives; among the
Stockbridge and Oneida nearly all of the old culture is lost. It is to be
hoped that all of the colorful pattern of Indian culture and tradition is
not lost in the process of assimilation.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, the Indians of Wisconsin, along with most of
those of the entire United States, have suffered much at the hands of the
white man. They deserve constructive help now toward accomplishing the
ultimate adjustment to the final demands made on them by the white
man&rsquo;s civilization.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
